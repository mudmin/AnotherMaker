I had mariadb on my pi so I'm using that database.  Otherwise, you can use any database that you have remote access to.

Here is a link of how to install a database server on your pi.

You will also need the following node installed
node-red-node-mysql

Do that by going the hamburger menu->manage palette->install
Search for node-red-node-mysql and click install
