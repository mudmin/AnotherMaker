Get the boards here: https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/EPROM_Booster_Program_Higher_voltage_Vintage_Eproms_on_your_XGECU_T48_866ii_353885a0.html

The cheaper XGECU Programmers are not capable of programming EPROMS at higher voltages. Even when you try to apply 25v, it often only puts out 21v.  This board allows you to decouple the VPP from the programmer and supply external voltage.
