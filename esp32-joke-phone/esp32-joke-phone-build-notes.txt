The weird parts:
I'm not using a library to connect between the 2 boards, so I'm sending weird octal and hex codes. Because of this some things are kind of weird in the code.
Codes look like this...
//volume
sendCommand(0x06, 0, 5);
0x06 tells it to change the volume, 0 is a low byte and needs to be there. Volume numbers are between 5 and 30. Because it's an octal you probably don't want to use volumes that end in 8 or 9.  Weird. I know.

//equalizer
  sendCommand(0x07, 0, 5);  //I thin there are 7 modes

The main one is playing tracks.  Before I play a track, I set the volume. I've had glitches make it go to full volume, so I always set it first. Even without an amp, it's LOUD.

Ok, so it gets even weirder.  Files need to begin with 4 numbers, but ending 8s and 9s seem to screw it up, soooo.  The file can have whatever after the 0001 so 0001FavoriteJoke.mp3 is fine.

*** all of the files go on a fat32 formatted sd card inside a folder called (all lowercase) mp3

Picking up the phone plays an mp3 file just so you know something will happen.  That file is...
0015whatever.mp3

Numbers 1-7 on the keypad are 0001-0007 respectively
numbers 8-0 are 0010,0011,0012
* is 0013
# is 0014

Hanging up the phone shuts off the sound.
Pushing a number cancels the existing track and jumps right to the next one. Pretty slick, actually.

For reference, it's this ESP32 Board

Connected to this MP3 Player

The MP3 Player gets 5v, Ground, RX and TX from the ESP32
Rx and TX are a serial connection using pins 16,17 of the esp. (line 62 of the code)

The code is pretty well commented explaining where all the wires go if you build another one or modify this one.
