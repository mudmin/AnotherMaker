On the node red side, you will need to install 2 additional nodes in the pallet manager.

node-red-node-serialport will allow you to read the serial data from the Arduino
node-red-contrib-message-counter will let you count your fidgets

The sensors in my arduino sketch are merely examples.  Literally any input can be used to trigger something in node red.

The execute node (which is built in) lets you trigger any commands that your logged in user can trigger.

I used some scripts to do the chrome and visual basic scripts, but mine are just examples to get you started.

I have a bunch of libraries in this repo which may or may not be needed depending on which sensors you use.
