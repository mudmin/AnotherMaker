Download Ubuntu for Pi
https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi

Burn to 8gb+ SD card with BalenaEtcher or similar

Enter this in the terminal
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip python-virtualenv
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev

sudo apt install nano
sudo apt install ftp
virtualenv env/
pip install --upgrade 'setuptools<45.0.0'
pip install rdpy
 . env/bin/activate
pip install opencanary

opencanaryd --copyconfig
sudo nano /root/.opencanary.conf (orange pi)
sudo nano /home/ubuntu/.opencanary.conf (raspberry pi)

See this guide to setup email
https://opencanary.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alerts/email.html

IMPORTANT for UBUNTU!
After making changes to /home/ubuntu/.opencanary.conf make sure to rename the file to "opencanary.conf" by removing the leading period.
If you do not, then you will get an error when starting the canary stating the following: "Error: config does not have 'logger' section"

opencanaryd --start

PLEASE NOTE:
I believe this WILL work on an original Pi or the Pi Zero, but it will need some tweaking.
The install process is ridiculously slow on these devices and I'm not going to spend any more
time trying to figure it out.  You will need to use Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Rasbian) due to
the Arm Cortex v6 Processor as opposed to the v7 in the later Pi's.  Please comment on the video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RanpEQBvAY0 to let us know how you got it to work.

Note #2:  For running automatically on boot. Courtesy of Matthew Bowels in the YT comments
sudo -i (this will run all commands as root, you NEED to do everything as root)
run the install instructions (as root) all the way up to the --copyconfig
make a script to run it (nano /usr/loca/bin/opencanary.sh)
Script should be
             #!/bin/bash
             ./usr/local/bin/opencanary.sh
             (exit the editor while saving)
Make script executable (chmod x+ /usr/local/bin/opencanary.sh)
test script ( ./usr/local/bin/opencanary.sh)
it should be running now if not stop and troubleshoot that
Make it run on boot with crontab -e
@reboot /usr/loca/bin/opencanary.sh (save and exit)
Reboot and it should be running.

NOW I am sure that running this as root is not ideal but i could not get it to work any other way for me
and since the device is intended to be probed by hackers nothing should be running on this so i don't think
its a HUGE deal but if someone else could make this work as a normal user then i would do that.

Note #3: Courtesy of mannydr3 on github
I had to install testresources then launchpadlib before getting it to work:
pip3 install testresources && pip3 install launchpadlib
